`@kata-kit/theme` contains source code for the kata-kit theming framework.

We use `styled-components` for styling our components, which combines the power of styled-components, as well as the familiarity of regular SCSS, through the power of tagged template literals. This package provides top-level and inner-level style resets, as well as abstractions on top of styled-components, which allows for simpler component theming.
